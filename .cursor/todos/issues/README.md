## Key Principles

### Consistency Across Packages

All codec packages (`@squoosh-kit/resize`, `@squoosh-kit/webp`, future ones) should:
- Use identical API patterns
- Have consistent parameter ordering
- Share validation and error handling
- Follow same build/packaging approach

### Non-Breaking Where Possible

- Use deprecation + new APIs (Issue #1)
- Maintain backward compatibility for v0.x
- Plan breaking changes for v1.0

### Quality Over Speed

- Prioritize correctness
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Clear error messages

### Code Reusability

- Create shared helpers in `@squoosh-kit/runtime`
- DRY principle for validation, WASM loading, etc.
- Generic implementations applied to all packages
