# Squoosh-Lite Production Readiness Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the `@squoosh-lite/core` package and a roadmap to make it 100% production-ready for publishing to npm.

## 1. Executive Summary

The project is well-structured with a solid foundation, leveraging modern TypeScript features, subpath exports, and a worker-first architecture. However, several critical areas must be addressed before it can be considered production-ready.

**Key Blockers:**

1.  **Broken Type Declarations:** The current build process does not generate TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`), which is a critical failure for a TypeScript library.
2.  **No Automated Testing:** The absence of a test suite makes it impossible to verify functionality, prevent regressions, or refactor with confidence.
3.  **Missing Package Metadata:** Essential `package.json` fields are missing, which will hinder discovery and adoption on npm.

**Recommendations Overview:**

- **High Priority:** Fix the build process, implement a comprehensive test suite, and complete the `package.json` metadata.
- **Medium Priority:** Introduce linting and formatting, improve code quality by removing `any` types, and enhance documentation.
- **Low Priority:** Plan the migration to a monorepo architecture.

## 2. Package Configuration (`package.json`)

A well-configured `package.json` is essential for discoverability, trust, and usability.

#### 2.1. Missing Metadata

The following fields should be added:

- `author`: Your name and/or organization.
- `license`: An OSI-approved license (e.g., "MIT" or "Apache-2.0"). A `LICENSE` file exists, but it should be declared here.
- `repository`: Link to the GitHub repository.
- `homepage`: Link to a project homepage or the repository.
- `keywords`: An array of strings to help users find the package (e.g., "squoosh", "webp", "image", "resize", "wasm", "bun").
- `bugs`: Link to the repository's issue tracker.

#### 2.2. Scripting and Automation

The `scripts` section should be expanded to include standard development workflows.

- **`test`**: A script to run the test suite (e.g., `bun test`).
- **`lint`**: A script to run a linter (e.g., `eslint . --ext .ts`).
- **`format`**: A script to run a formatter (e.g., `prettier --write .`).
- **`check-types`**: A script to run the TypeScript compiler for type checking (`tsc --noEmit`).

#### 2.3. Build Script Improvements

The `build` script is functional but could be improved for clarity and correctness.

```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rm -rf dist",
  "build:declarations": "tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --outDir dist",
  "build:code": "bun build --sourcemap --minify --format=esm --splitting --target=bun --outdir=dist src/index.ts src/features/webp/index.ts src/features/webp/webp.worker.ts src/features/resize/index.ts src/features/resize/resize.worker.ts",
  "build": "bun run clean && bun run scripts/copy-codecs.ts && bun run build:declarations && bun run build:code",
  "prepublishOnly": "bun run build"
}
```

This separates concerns and makes the build process more transparent and easier to debug.

## 3. Build and Tooling

A robust build process and standardized tooling are non-negotiable for a production library.

#### 3.1. Type Declaration (`.d.ts`) Generation (CRITICAL)

The `tsconfig.json` is configured with `"emitDeclarationOnly": true`, but the `build` script in `package.json` never invokes `tsc`. The `bun build` command does not currently generate declaration files from TypeScript source. This means consumers of the package will not have any types.

**Solution:**
The build script must be updated to explicitly run `tsc` to generate declaration files. The suggested script in section 2.3 already includes this fix (`build:declarations`).

#### 3.2. Linting and Formatting

To ensure code consistency and prevent common errors, ESLint (linter) and Prettier (formatter) should be installed and configured.

**Action Items:**

1.  Add `eslint` and `prettier` as `devDependencies`.
2.  Create configuration files (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc.json`).
3.  Add `lint` and `format` scripts to `package.json`.
4.  Consider using a pre-commit hook (e.g., with Husky) to automate checks.

## 4. Code Quality & Best Practices

The codebase is generally clean but has some areas for improvement.

#### 4.1. Use of `any` Type

The project's development guidelines state, "NEVER use 'any' type". This rule is violated in `src/features/webp/webp.worker.ts`:

- `(global as any).self = global;`
- `(self as any).location = { href: import.meta.url };`
- `module.encode(data as any, ...)`

While the `global as any` might be a necessary evil for the environment polyfill, the type cast on `data` should be investigated. The types from the WASM module (`webp_enc.d.ts`) should be checked for correctness or augmented to avoid this cast.

#### 4.2. Environment Polyfills

The worker code includes polyfills for `self` and `self.location` when running under Bun. This is a clever workaround but has drawbacks:

- It pollutes the global scope.
- It's not immediately obvious why it's there.

**Recommendation:**
This behavior should be clearly documented in the code. An explanatory comment block should be added to detail why the polyfill is necessary for the Emscripten-generated glue code to function correctly in a Bun environment.

#### 4.3. Error Handling

The use of `AbortSignal` is excellent. The error handling within workers is also good, correctly propagating error messages. This should be maintained and tested.

## 5. Testing Strategy

A library without tests is not production-ready. A comprehensive test suite provides confidence for users and maintainers.

#### 5.1. Framework Choice

`bun:test` is the natural choice for this project. It's fast, built-in, and requires minimal configuration.

#### 5.2. What to Test

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test the `createEncodeOptions` function in `webp.worker.ts` to ensure it correctly maps simplified options to the full Squoosh options.
  - Test other utility functions.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test the full `webpEncode` and `resize` flows in both `'worker'` and `'client'` modes.
  - Use small, known image fixtures (e.g., a 2x2 red square) and assert that the output is as expected (e.g., correct dimensions, or decodes to the correct pixels).
  - Test the `AbortSignal` functionality to ensure that long-running operations can be cancelled.
  - Test edge cases: invalid options, malformed image data, etc.

## 6. Documentation

Good documentation is as important as the code itself.

#### 6.1. `README.md`

The `README.md` should be enhanced to include:

- **Installation Instructions**: `bun add @squoosh-lite/core`
- **API Reference**: A detailed breakdown of the exported functions (`encode`, `resize`, `createWebpEncoder`, etc.), their parameters, and return values.
- **Usage Examples**: Clear, concise examples for both browser and Bun environments.
- **Performance Considerations**: Guidance on when to use `'worker'` vs `'client'` mode.
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How others can contribute to the project.

#### 6.2. TSDoc

The existing TSDoc comments are good. This practice should be continued to ensure that all public APIs are documented, which allows for auto-generated API documentation.

---

## 7. Future Architecture: Monorepo

The goal of evolving to a monorepo is a good one. It will allow for better separation of concerns and independent versioning of features.

**Roadmap:**

1.  Introduce a workspace manager (e.g., Bun workspaces, Turborepo, Nx).
2.  Move `@squoosh-lite/core` into a `packages/core` directory.
3.  Create new packages for each feature (e.g., `packages/webp`, `packages/resize`).
4.  The `core` package could become a thin wrapper that re-exports functionality from the feature packages, or it could be deprecated in favor of users installing only what they need (e.g., `@squoosh-lite/webp`).
